# NSW Rental Bond Outcomes (2024)

A static, client-side site that maps NSW postcodes and summarises **rental bond refund outcomes** for 2024.
Colour encodes rank by the chosen metric (green = lower, red = higher). Filters include dwelling type, days bond held, 
data-point counts, and advanced ranges (percent withheld, any withheld, total bond). Cards and map popups show the same per-postcode summary.
